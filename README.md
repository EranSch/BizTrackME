#BizTrackME
_Business managment milleniums ahead of the curve_

##Notes
Until a database compoenent is integrated, this application relies on two txt files. `customers.txt` and `products.txt` MUST be accessible by the server component!

##Usage
1. Start the server by executing the `RunServer.bat` script or executing the JAR directly.
2. Start client by executing the `RunClient.bat` script or executing the JAR directly.
3. Get to work!
